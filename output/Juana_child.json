    "backstory": "I was born in Spain, where my parents met while fighting for the Spanish civil war. My mother was a fervent communist, one of the leaders of The Cause. My father had travelled there all the way from the Netherlands. But in the war he lost my mother and with her his faith in the cause and humanity at large. He took me back to the Netherlands. I was 9 when Germany invaded The Netherlands. My father had seen what was coming and shipped me off to England January that year. It is there that they told me he was executed in the second week of occupation. They knew he was a communist.",
