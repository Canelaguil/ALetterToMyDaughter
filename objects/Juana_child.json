    "backstory": "I was born in Spain, where my parents met while fighting for the Spanish civil war. My mother was a fervent communist, one of the leaders of The Cause. My father had travelled there all the way from the Netherlands. But he never came back. Right before  the communists lost, my mother packed up and took me to the Netherlands. She didn't even speak the language. Her dark, Spanish features got us mistaken for Jews. I was 13 when Germany invaded The Netherlands. My mother had seen what was coming and shipped me off to England January that year. It is there that they told me she was executed in the second week of occupation. They considered her a Jewish commie.",
